# High Performance Computing (HPC) on AWS

High Performance Computing (HPC) involves the use of parallel processing for running advanced application programs efficiently, reliably, and quickly. AWS offers a comprehensive suite of services for building and managing HPC workloads.

## Overview

AWS allows you to increase the speed of research and reduce time-to-results by running HPC in the cloud and scaling to larger numbers of parallel tasks than would be practical in most on-premises environments. AWS helps you save money by providing CPU, GPU, and FPGA instances on-demand with no upfront costs.

## AWS HPC Components:

**1. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2):** Provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers.

**2. Amazon EC2 Elastic GPUs:** Allows you to easily attach low-cost graphics acceleration to current generation EC2 instances.

**3. AWS Batch:** Enables developers, scientists, and engineers to easily and efficiently run hundreds of thousands of batch computing jobs on AWS.

**4. AWS Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA):** A network interface for Amazon EC2 instances that enables customers to run applications requiring high levels of inter-node communications (like HPC applications) at scale on AWS.

**5. AWS ParallelCluster:** An AWS-supported open-source cluster management tool that makes it easy for you to deploy and manage High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters on AWS.

**6. Amazon FSx for Lustre:** A high performance file system optimized for fast processing of workloads such as machine learning, HPC, video processing, financial modeling, and electronic design automation (EDA).

## How to Setup HPC on AWS

Setting up an HPC environment in AWS involves a number of steps:

1. Choose your EC2 instances: For compute-intensive tasks, you might choose instances from the C, R, H, or F families. For GPU-intensive tasks, P or G instances could be suitable.

2. Set up networking: For HPC tasks, a low-latency, high-throughput network is often necessary. Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) provides this capability for EC2 instances. You'll also need to configure your VPC and subnets appropriately.

3. Set up storage: Amazon S3, Amazon EBS, or Amazon FSx for Lustre could be appropriate storage solutions for an HPC workload, depending on your requirements for durability, availability, and performance.

4. Set up an HPC cluster: AWS ParallelCluster provides a simple way to set up and manage an HPC cluster in AWS. You can specify instance types, configure networking, choose a scheduler (like Slurm, SGE, or Torque), and set up shared storage.

5. Manage your workload: You might use AWS Batch to easily manage batch computing workloads. This could include queuing jobs, launching additional compute resources as necessary, and then scaling down when the workload is complete.

6. Monitor and optimize: AWS CloudWatch provides detailed monitoring for your resources, and AWS Cost Explorer can help you understand and manage your costs. You might also use Elastic Load Balancing to distribute incoming application traffic across multiple targets.

7. Secure your environment: You should also ensure that your environment is secure. This could include setting up security groups and NACLs, using IAM to manage access, and encrypting data at rest and in transit.

## AWS HPC Use Cases:

- Computational fluid dynamics
- Financial modeling
- Genomic sequencing
- Machine Learning & AI
- Seismic Analysis

With HPC on AWS, you can efficiently and dynamically store and compute your data, regardless of volume and intensity. AWS provides cost-effective, scalable and secure solutions that help researchers and engineers focus on their work rather than their IT infrastructure.
