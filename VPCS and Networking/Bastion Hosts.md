# AWS Bastion Host Guide

## Introduction
A Bastion Host, also known as a Jump Server, is an instance that sits within your public subnet and is typically accessed using SSH or RDP. Once remote connectivity has been established with the bastion host, it then acts as a 'jump' point from which you can manage other instances in private subnets.

## Why Use Bastion Hosts

- The primary role of a bastion host is to serve as a gateway for SSH or RDP traffic to instances in your VPC.

- Bastion hosts help reduce exposure to attacks as you need to expose only the bastion host to the internet.

- They are a critical part of a security plan to protect sensitive resources within the network.

## Setting Up a Bastion Host

1. Launch an EC2 instance in your public subnet that will serve as the bastion host.

2. Configure your security groups. The security group for your bastion host should accept SSH or RDP traffic only from trusted IP addresses. The security group for your private instances should accept SSH or RDP traffic only from the bastion host.

3. Connect to the bastion host using SSH or RDP. From there, connect to an instance in your private subnet.

## Best Practices

- Restrict IP addresses: Limit SSH or RDP access on bastion hosts to trusted IP addresses.

- Regular patching: Regularly update and patch the bastion host.

- Use strong authentication methods: Implement strong security measures like multi-factor authentication, key pairs, and strong passwords.

- Use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager: It lets you manage your EC2 instances without exposing them to the internet, removing the need for bastion hosts.

- Enable logging: Make sure to enable VPC Flow Logs and CloudTrail for your bastion hosts to have a record of actions and traffic.

## Conclusion
In AWS, a Bastion Host serves as a bridge to connect to instances within private subnets from the internet. It plays a critical role in limiting threats such as hacking and is an important part of a layered approach to security. Remember, bastion hosts themselves can be targets, so it's important to harden these systems and restrict access to them. Always consider the principle of least privilege in granting access to the bastion host.
