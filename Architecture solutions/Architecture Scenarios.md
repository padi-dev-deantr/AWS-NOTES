Here are five scenarios along with the solutions that a Solutions Architect might consider when deploying applications on AWS:

1. **Scenario**: A small start-up is developing a new application that they expect to quickly grow in popularity. They want to focus on rapid development and deployment without having to worry about infrastructure setup and scaling issues.

    **Solution**: The Solutions Architect might recommend using AWS Elastic Beanstalk for deploying the application. With Elastic Beanstalk, the start-up can simply upload their code and let the service handle all of the deployment details such as resource provisioning, load balancing, and automatic scaling. Amazon RDS could be used for managed database needs, and Amazon S3 for storing static content and user uploads.

2. **Scenario**: A media company is planning to host their video content online. They want to ensure high availability and fast delivery of their content to users worldwide.

    **Solution**: The Solutions Architect could propose using Amazon S3 for storing the original videos due to its high durability. For delivery, they could utilize Amazon CloudFront, a global Content Delivery Network (CDN), to cache video content closer to the viewers, ensuring high availability and performance.

3. **Scenario**: An e-commerce company is preparing for a big sales event and expects a significant increase in website traffic during this period. They want to ensure their website remains highly available and performant under heavy load.

    **Solution**: The Solutions Architect might suggest using Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to handle changes in demand and Elastic Load Balancer to distribute incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances. To handle session data, Amazon DynamoDB, a NoSQL database, could be used due to its ability to handle high request rates. To further reduce load, static content could be served from Amazon S3 and delivered via CloudFront.

4. **Scenario**: A healthcare organization wants to migrate their on-premises applications and data to the cloud. They need to comply with strict regulations for data security and privacy.

    **Solution**: The Solutions Architect should recommend Amazon VPC for network isolation and Amazon Macie for discovering and protecting sensitive data. To secure data at rest, they might use services like Amazon RDS and Amazon S3 with server-side encryption enabled. Data in transit could be secured using TLS certificates from AWS Certificate Manager. AWS Key Management Service could be used to manage cryptographic keys for data encryption.

5. **Scenario**: A financial services firm wants to run complex, long-duration analytics on their data stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. They don't want to manage the compute resources for these jobs.

    **Solution**: The Solutions Architect could recommend Amazon Athena for serverless SQL queries directly against the S3 data, and Amazon EMR for more complex, long-running data processing. For visualization, Amazon QuickSight could be suggested. To orchestrate and schedule these jobs, AWS Glue or AWS Step Functions could be used.

Remember, while these solutions are valid, the best solution always depends on the specific requirements, constraints, and context of each individual project. It's essential for a Solutions Architect to thoroughly understand these factors in order to architect the most effective and efficient solutions on AWS.
