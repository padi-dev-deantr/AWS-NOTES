## AWS Snow Family

The AWS Snow Family consists of three physical devices - Snowcone, Snowball, and Snowmobile - that help to physically transport up to exabytes of data into and out of AWS. This is especially useful when you're limited by a network connection that is too slow, too expensive, or nonexistent.

### AWS Snowcone

Snowcone is the smallest member of the AWS Snow Family of edge computing and data transfer devices. It's lightweight, portable, and rugged, making it ideal for use cases like data migration, content distribution, tactical edge computing, healthcare IoT, and industrial IoT.

### AWS Snowball

Snowball is a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure devices to transfer large amounts of data into and out of AWS. Using Snowball helps to eliminate challenges that can be encountered with large-scale data transfers, including high network costs, long transfer times, and security concerns.

### AWS Snowmobile

Snowmobile is an exabyte-scale data transfer service used to move extremely large amounts of data to AWS. You can transfer up to 100 PB per Snowmobile, a 45-foot long ruggedized shipping container, pulled by a semi-trailer truck.

## Amazon FSx

Amazon FSx provides fully managed third-party file systems. There are two main offerings: Amazon FSx for Windows File Server and Amazon FSx for Lustre.

### Amazon FSx for Windows File Server

This provides a fully managed native Microsoft Windows file system so you can easily move your Windows-based applications that require file storage to AWS. It's built on Windows Server and offers a rich set of enterprise storage capabilities.

### Amazon FSx for Lustre

This is a fully managed file system that is optimized for compute-intensive workloads, such as high-performance computing, machine learning, and media data processing workflows. It provides sub-millisecond access to data and is integrated with Amazon S3.

Remember, while these are fully managed services, always follow best practices for data management including backing up your data, applying necessary security configurations, and testing your setup to ensure it meets your needs.
