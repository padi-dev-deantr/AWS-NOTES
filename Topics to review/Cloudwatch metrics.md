Explanation: Amazon CloudWatch is a powerful monitoring tool that comes with several pre-defined metrics for EC2 instances such as CPU utilization, Disk Reads/Writes, and Network packets in/out. However, Memory Utilization is not a metric that is automatically tracked by CloudWatch. To monitor Memory Utilization, you have to manually set up a custom metric. This usually involves installing and configuring additional software (such as the Amazon CloudWatch Monitoring Scripts for Linux) on your EC2 instances to periodically collect memory utilization data and send it to CloudWatch.
