# AWS Disaster Recovery Strategies Guide

Disaster Recovery (DR) on AWS is about setting up and testing scenarios to ensure your applications and data can be made available as fast as possible in the event of a disaster. The four primary strategies are: Backup and Restore, Pilot Light, Warm Standby, and Multi-Site.

## 1. Backup and Restore

Backup and Restore is the simplest and least expensive DR strategy. The idea is to back up your data and applications from anywhere to the AWS cloud. You can back up your data to S3 buckets and EC2 instances. In the event of a disaster, you restore them onto AWS.

### Key Concepts:

- **Data Backup:** Back up data regularly to S3. It's secure, highly scalable, and supports versioning and lifecycle policies to manage backups and archives effectively.
  
- **AMI:** Amazon Machine Images can be used to back up your server configurations.

- **RDS Snapshots:** These are used for backing up and restoring your relational database service.

- **EC2 EBS Snapshots:** For non-relational databases and applications running on EC2 instances, you can take periodic snapshots.

## 2. Pilot Light

The term Pilot Light is a reference to the small flame that keeps a traditional gas heater ready to burst into action instantly. In this scenario, the core elements of your system are already set up and running in AWS. When a disaster happens, you can rapidly provision a full-scale production environment around the critical core or "Pilot Light".

### Key Concepts:

- **Data Replication:** Data is replicated to the cloud, and all infrastructure components are set up, but not fully deployed.

- **Quick Scaling:** In the event of a disaster, resources around the "Pilot Light" are quickly provisioned to enable full-scale production.

## 3. Warm Standby

A Warm Standby DR strategy extends the Pilot Light elements and reduces the recovery time because some services are always running. In case of a disaster, you can quickly scale up this environment to handle the production load.

### Key Concepts:

- **Scaling:** A minimal version of the environment is always running in the cloud. In the event of a disaster, you quickly scale up to handle the production load.

- **RDS Multi-AZ/Read Replicas:** Database instances are continually replicated, ensuring quick failover if needed.

## 4. Multi-Site

The Multi-Site strategy enables you to run your application in AWS and on your existing on-site infrastructure in an active-active configuration. The data replication method that you employ will be determined by the recovery point that you choose.

### Key Concepts:

- **Active-Active:** The system runs in more than one location all the time. In the event of a disaster, the traffic is routed away from the affected site.

- **Route53:** AWS Route 53 can be used to route traffic to different sites based on a variety of methods, including Latency Based Routing, Geo DNS, and Weighted Round Robin.

## Conclusion

The AWS Cloud enables flexible and cost-effective DR strategies. The choice of strategy depends on the recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO) of your organization. AWS provides a broad set of services and features you can leverage to execute these strategies effectively and reliably.
