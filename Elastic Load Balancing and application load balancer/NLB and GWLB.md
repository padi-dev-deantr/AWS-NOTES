## Network Load Balancer (NLB)

Network Load Balancer operates at the transport layer (Layer 4) of the OSI model and is capable of handling millions of requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latencies. 

**Features of NLB**:

- **Performance**: Network Load Balancer is designed to handle volatile traffic patterns and tens of thousands of connections per second.

- **Static IP or Elastic IP address support**: With NLB, you can assign a static IP address per Availability Zone or use an Elastic IP address.

- **TLS Termination**: NLB supports TLS termination, enabling the load balancer to offload the work of decrypting incoming secure (TLS) connections.

- **Zonal Isolation**: Ensures that each Availability Zone is isolated from failures in other Availability Zones.

**Use Cases of NLB**:

Network Load Balancer is ideal for load balancing TCP traffic where extreme performance is required. It's suited for applications that need to handle millions of requests per second and maintain ultra-low latencies, such as real-time video streaming, gaming, etc.

## Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)

Gateway Load Balancer provides load balancing and auto scaling for fleets of third-party appliances. It combines a transparent network gateway (that is, a single entry and exit point for all traffic) and a load balancer that distributes traffic and scales your virtual appliances with traffic demands.

**Features of GWLB**:

- **Simplified Deployment**: GWLB makes it easy to deploy, scale, and run third-party virtual appliances.

- **Transparent Traffic Inspection**: It provides a transparent, passive network gateway for routing traffic, and the ability to work with sequence-sensitive traffic streams.

- **Horizontal Scaling**: GWLB allows horizontal scaling of third-party virtual appliances.

**Use Cases of GWLB**:

Gateway Load Balancer is perfect when you need to inspect and filter traffic flowing in and out of a VPC. This includes scenarios like deploying a firewall fleet, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and deep packet inspection systems.

Keep in mind that NLB and GWLB serve different purposes and are used in different scenarios. While NLB is great for extreme performance needs, GWLB is more for scaling and managing third-party appliances within your network. Always choose the load balancer that best fits your needs.
