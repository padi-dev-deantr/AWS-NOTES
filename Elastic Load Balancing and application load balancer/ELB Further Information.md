## Sticky Sessions

Sticky Sessions, also known as session affinity, enable the load balancer to bind a user's session to a specific instance. This ensures that all requests from the user during the session are sent to the same instance. Sticky sessions can be useful when you have a web application that stores information about the client's session on its own, and that data must be available to all requests from the client.

AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) supports sticky sessions using application-based cookies. You can set the duration for stickiness, after which the session is no longer "sticky" and subsequent requests from the client could be routed to a different target.

## Cross-Zone Load Balancing

By default, each load balancer node distributes traffic across the registered targets in its Availability Zone only. If you enable cross-zone load balancing, each load balancer node distributes traffic across the registered targets in all enabled Availability Zones. This provides a more even distribution of requests to your applications.

Both ALB and NLB support cross-zone load balancing. For ALB, cross-zone load balancing is always enabled. For NLB, you can choose to enable or disable cross-zone load balancing.

## SSL Certificates

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a protocol for secure transmission of private documents over the internet. SSL uses a cryptographic system that uses two keys to encrypt data.

Load balancers use SSL certificates to terminate SSL/TLS connections, offloading the work of encrypting and decrypting traffic from the backend servers. You can upload your SSL certificates to AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), and then associate them with your load balancer.

AWS also offers the AWS Certificate Manager service, which handles the complexity of creating, storing, and managing SSL/TLS certificates.

## Connection Draining

Connection Draining, also known as connection termination, enables the load balancer to complete in-flight requests made to instances that are de-registering or unhealthy. When Connection Draining is enabled, the load balancer will not send any new requests to the instance that is de-registering, but allows existing requests to complete within a specified timeout period.

Connection Draining is useful during instance maintenance and deployments, as well as auto scaling down events, to ensure that in-flight requests are handled gracefully.

Each of these features offers you more control over the routing and handling of incoming requests to your applications, and allows you to optimize for your application's specific needs and behaviors.
