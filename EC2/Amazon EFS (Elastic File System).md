Amazon EFS provides scalable file storage for use with Amazon EC2 and other AWS services. It's easy to use and offers a simple interface for creating and configuring file systems.

## Features

- `Scalable`: EFS is automatically scalable, growing and shrinking as files are added and removed, so you don't have to manage storage provisioning.

- `Shared Access`: Multiple EC2 instances can access an EFS file system at the same time, allowing EFS to provide a common data source for workloads and applications running on more than one instance.

- `Durable and Available`: EFS is designed to be highly durable and available. It stores data redundantly across multiple AZs in a region.

- `Consistency`: EFS provides strong consistency models, ensuring that all file system operations are atomic, meaning they either succeed completely or fail without making changes.

- `Security`: You can use AWS security features with EFS, including IAM for access control, Security Groups for VPC firewall rules, and encryption of data at rest or in transit.

## Use Cases

- `Big data and analytics`: Can handle large-scale analytics workloads.

- `Web serving & content management`: Serve web content, or manage and store content in its native hierarchical format.

- `Application development & testing`: Store code repositories, perform builds and do testing.

- `Media processing workflows`: Process, store, and serve media (photos, audio, and video).

- `Database backups`: Store database backup files for recovery purposes.

## Pricing

You only pay for the amount of storage used by your file system, there is no pre-provisioning required.
